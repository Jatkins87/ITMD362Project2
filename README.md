# ITMD362Project2
Overall, the group worked pretty well together. Unfortunately, our time was managed pretty poorly. I feel that we relied on David too much and did not take charge as much as the rest of the members should have. There were small validation errors that cost us half in the first turn in that really didn’t make sense on why it was so harsh for how minor the errors were. But, it is what it is. 

Vinny:
He talked to us in group chat a few times? But never made any of our physical meets, and his contributions were nonexistent.

Bohdan:
He had valuable information for the off the wall questions that occurred, and when was a constant in our group discussions.  Created the initial skeleton for the site, and helped the project move forward.

David:
White knight. Knight in shining armor. Moses parting the Red Sea. He is a saint. As a group, we failed David. He picked up the slack and did the work of two people, and that shouldn’t have happened. However, I feel that if we didn’t have him keeping us in check, the project would have been in a different place entirely. I love this man.
